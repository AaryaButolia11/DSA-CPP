# Convert Temperature (Celsius to Kelvin and Fahrenheit)

### Problem Statement
Link - https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-the-temperature/description/
You are given a non-negative floating point number rounded to two decimal places `celsius`, that denotes the temperature in Celsius.

You should convert Celsius into:
- Kelvin: `Kelvin = Celsius + 273.15`
- Fahrenheit: `Fahrenheit = Celsius × 1.80 + 32.00`

You must return it as an array `ans = [kelvin, fahrenheit]`.

**Note**: Answers within 10⁻⁵ of the actual answer will be accepted.

### Intuition
The formulas for conversion between temperature units are standard and straightforward. By directly applying these formulas, we can convert the input Celsius value to both Kelvin and Fahrenheit.

---

### Approach
1. Take the input Celsius temperature.
2. Use the formula `Kelvin = Celsius + 273.15` to compute the Kelvin value.
3. Use the formula `Fahrenheit = Celsius × 1.80 + 32.00` to compute the Fahrenheit value.
4. Return both results in a vector.

### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(1) — only basic arithmetic operations.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) — only two variables are used to store the results.

### Example
Input:
celsius = 36.50
Output:
[309.65000, 97.70000]
